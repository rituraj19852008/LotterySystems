An exciting new lottery game is being launched. The game is simple to play!

Players guess six numbers ranging from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

 

Because it has been such a difficult time for many, the lottery company has decided that they are feeling generous and that every ticket is a winner!

 

Winnings are calculated as follows:

=====================================

 

If the player guessed fewer than three correct numbers for the draw, they will win the sum of the numbers drawn.

Example: player numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 winning numbers: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 prize: £57

 

 

If the player guessed three to five numbers correctly, they will win £500 for every number they guessed, plus the multiplication of every number which they missed.

Example: player numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 winning numbers: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 prize: £2,056

 

If the player guessed all six numbers correctly, they will win £10,000 multiplied by the sum of every number drawn!

Example: player numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 winning numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 prize: £210,000
